	<h1>Armada</h1>
	<h2>"Outsmart your foes with Tactical Finesse" - Official BAR Page</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Armada relies mainly on mobility, versatility, stealth, and direct firepower. They are much more flexible than Cortex, in which their units generally are much more specialized with ground units having cloakable technology. The same can be said for economy buildings like the cloakable metal extractor and cloakable fusion reactor. 
		The tradeoff for Armada is that their units are much weaker in comparisoon to Cortex's units. Their air force especially has somewhat inferior durability, but compensate by having a wider cast of air units like Atomic and EMP bombers, as well as having stealth transports for sneaky insertions with ground vehicles or infantry.

	<section class="cortex faction">
	<h1>Cortex</h1>
	<h2>"Smash your foes with Brute Force" - Official BAR Page</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Cortex relies mainly on overwhelming firepower, tough frontline units, and makes consistent use of artillery. 
		To every Cortex player, every problem can be struck with a hammer to a nail. In other words, despite being less versatile, they make up in numbers and superior stats except in mobility. And what they lack in mobility, they make-up in superior firepower.
		Play this faction if you prefer a more conventional frontline playstyle.

	<section class="legion faction">
	<h1>Legion</h1>
	<h2>"Blot out the sky with drones or plow the ground with railguns, what you are seeing is advanced warfare!" - anonymous</h2>
		<div>
			<p>While legion is not officially a faction yet, they make great use of drones, as well as buildings that can help support friendly units in the battlefield. They can utilize a building called the Hive, which can be built in a row or column to be capable of mass producing hundreds of drones that can render enemy defenses useless.
			Legion players tend to not expose themmselves directly on the battlefield, instead tending to the defenses of their allied players and able to provide anti-swarm capable units by mass-producing their own swarm of drones. It is important to note once again, that the Legion is not officially out yet and is currently in an unbalanced state.
			Be wary when enabling this faction for yourself or for the other team.

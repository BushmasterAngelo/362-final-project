	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Q: Is this an official wiki?</p>
		<p>A: No. This is completely unofficial by passionate fans of the project.</p>
		<p>Q: It seems very barebones right now, do any of you plan to make it into a full-fledged wiki? Perhaps like a BARpedia?</p>
		<p>A: That was the initial intent for the development of the site. The wiki will be completely open to anyone who is a verified editor in order to to help expand into a much more conventional looking wiki for the game.</p>
		<p>Q: There is already a fandom page for this game, will this be an issue with development of the wiki as a whole?</p>
		<p>A: The fandom wiki won't be an issue. The purpose of this project is to make it completely ad-free and open-source for anyone to read and revise information that either refers directly from the official BAR website, or any present information in the game itself.</p>
		<p>Q: Do you plan on adding ads?</p>
		<p>A: Never. We plan to make this as bloatfree as possible for the sake of our honesty with promising a wiki free from monetization, and also for the sake of every viewer's sanity.</p>

	<h1>Rules</h1>
	<div>
		<h2>Rule 1: Harassment</h2>
		<p>Harassment of users and staff of anykind is prohibited. Report a user with the flag icon.<p>
		<h2>Rule 2: Editing</h2>
		<p>If you are an editor, it is imperative that you make the flow of information on this site as accessible and accurate to everyone using it. Please do not abuse this role, as misinformation will result in a complete permaban.
		<h2>Rule 3: Gatekeeping</h2>
		<p>Do not gatekeep or withhold information from users who are new to the game. Beyond All Reason is a collaborative, open-source video game project that relies on the support of the community and any form of intolerance to those who are new or veterans of the game will be punished severely.
		<h2>Rule 4: Copyright</h2>
		<p>Do not post copyright content without the owner's consent to said material.</p>
		<h2>Rule 5: Drama and Gossip</h2>
		<p>Please do not use this site to speak ill-will of developers, moderators, or players in any way shape or form. The last thing we the owners of this site worry about is BARchive being used as an outlet of hate, especially against developers.
